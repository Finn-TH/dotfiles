# üõ†Ô∏è Finn's Dotfiles

This is my personal **dotfiles setup**, managed with [Nix](https://nixos.org), [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager), and [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) on macOS.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è These dotfiles are tailored for my personal machine (macOS). It may not be the best as I'm still learning Nix in general. Feel free to fork and adapt!
