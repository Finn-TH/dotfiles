# 🛠️ Finn's Dotfiles

This is my personal **dotfiles setup**, managed with [Nix](https://nixos.org), [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager), and [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) on macOS.

It's fully declarative, portable, and built to support:

- ⚙️ Zsh with plugin & theme management
- 💅 Prompt switching (Powerlevel10k / Starship)
- 🔍 FZF, Zoxide, and other CLI tools
- 🖥️ Ghostty terminal
- 🔐 1Password SSH agent support
- ...and more!

## 💡 Usage

> ⚠️ These dotfiles are tailored for my personal machine (macOS). It may not be the best as I'm still learning Nix in general. Feel free to fork and adapt!
